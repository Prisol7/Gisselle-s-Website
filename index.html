            <div class="item-3"><p>My name is <b>Gisselle Camacho</b> and I am currently a junior at the 
                University of South Florida, majoring in Marketing to receive my Bachelor’s in 
                Business Administration. I was born and raised in Tampa going to Tampa Bay Technical H
                igh School all four years graduating with honors. At first, I wasn’t sure what career 
                I wanted to pursue and bounced around multiple ideas until I had a teacher my sophomore 
                year of high school and he focused on bringing me out of my shell because he saw the 
                potential I had and wanted to make sure I knew what I was capable of doing. This teacher 
                helped me realize the career field I wanted to go into and that was the business world. 
                After I graduated TBT, I went straight to Hillsborough Community College for two years to 
                receive my associate degree and transferred to USF my last semester.

            <div class="about-item-3">I picked business
                because there are multiple things to do in this field and it’s a way that everything is 
                set up. I like knowing the in and outs of things because knowing what going on besides t
                he scenes is what helps an organization thrive since it’s the backbone. My goal in the f
                uture is to work for a big company as a Marketing Manager representing sports team like 
                the New York Yankees. Later on, 
               I would love to own my own tattoo shop to let artists show their creativity.</div>

                They say a person can make a break or something you love like a sport or subject. The best academic experience for me was my first semester of college, I had a professor who was hands down one of the best teachers I’ve ever had. I say he was the best teacher because you could tell, he enjoyed doing his job and loved when students engaged in the conversation. When I spoke to him, he was made me feel as what I was saying was being heard and played an important role. College as a whole has not been the biggest change for me because I was always focused on my studies and preparing myself for the future. Not going to school is something I could not imagine since it’s helped shaped more of my time management and how I want to carry myself. College is definitely something that is not for everyone, but I believe it is a task people should try even if it’s one semester because it could show how a person is going to treat their career depending on what it is and this experience will teach something new about someone.

                 a real estate assistant at the same time for a few months. Currently, I am

                 s like running reports or helping their accounts when things do not look right
                 . One of the most important tasks is keeping my numbers up to date because as sta

                very month and we have to work for it since we are a slower moving club.</p></div>

            <div class="r-item-2"><p>During this course, I have learned numerous structures 
                about how business use these things to look at numbers and how they try to bring
                 more people in their corporation. A few examples of this include managerial desig
                 er, technical designer, and model builder. A few things they have in common is that 
                 their collecting data but they use it in different areas of a business to see which ne
                 eds to be looked how and how they are going to change what is marked as red. Managerial
                  designer looks at the management issues and how the technology should be used when it c
                  omes to what information should be collected and from where, also how data should be or
                  ganized. Technical designer focuses on questions about the data structure, user access,
                   response time and security measures. Questions for this design include what type of re
                   sponse time is required and what type of security measure should be installed. Model b
                   uilder is the relationship between users and designers because a person is responsible
                    for the supplying the information on what a model does, including the type of data in
                    put that is accepted, how model outputs should be interpreted, and
                 what assumptions that go into creating and using a model.</p></div>
